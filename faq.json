      "question": "What is management quota?",
      "answer": "Management quota refers to a government-authorized mechanism provided to private or deemed universities in India by which students can secure direct admission to an institute. It is a provision made by colleges and universities for students who want to secure admission to top colleges and universities based on their merit and by paying a higher fee than the regular fee. Management quota is only applicable in private or deemed universities because they don't receive any government funding. 85% of the seats are filled on a merit basis and the remaining 15% of seats can be filled by the management quota. The fees of a management quota student are usually 3 – 4 times the normal fees."

      "question": "What is the Non-Resident Indian ( NRI ) quota?",
      "answer": "NRI quota refers to a special reservation or allocation of seats in educational institutions in India that is allotted to non-resident Indians, Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs), and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs). This quota allows NRIs and PIOs to secure admission, often without the need to appear for entrance exams that residents must undertake. The students admitted under this quota are not necessarily NRIs themselves, but they must be sponsored by an NRI who is usually a close relative, such as a parent or grandparent. The number of seats reserved under the NRI-sponsored quota may vary depending on the institution. The NRI quota is available in all major branches of engineering, medicine, law, management, and other courses. NRI students can get admission in MBBS through NRI quota by clearing the NEET-UG exam, and in counseling, they can apply to medical colleges where NRI quota seats are available."
